# About me

Born in Rome (Italy) in 1987 and currently living in Berlin (Germany).

Since I was a kid, I’ve always liked drawing and creating stories: when I watched the first anime (Sailor Moon) and discovered the world of Japanese manga, a light brightened up my life.

I first kept on drawing as a self-taught artist and participated in 3 editions of the Silent Manga Audition contest (editions 15, 16 and 17).

In 2024 I graduated from a bi-annual manga course at Lucca Manga Academy. There, I also attended a course on manga editing.

Currently I am working on the pilot chapter of “The future is in your hands”.

I have 2 degrees (Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Tourism and Cultural Heritage) and I lived in different countries, such as Italy, China, France and Germany.

I am fond of food, foreign cultures and languages (I speak Italian, English, French, Chinese Mandarin and German).
