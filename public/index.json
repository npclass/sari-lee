[{"content":"\rAbout me\rBorn in Rome (Italy) in 1987 and currently living in Berlin (Germany).\nSince I was a kid, I’ve always liked drawing and creating stories: when I watched the first anime (Sailor Moon) and discovered the world of Japanese manga, a light brightened up my life.\nI first kept on drawing as a self-taught artist and participated in 3 editions of the Silent Manga Audition contest (editions 15, 16 and 17).\nIn 2024 I graduated from a bi-annual manga course at Lucca Manga Academy. There, I also attended a course on manga editing.\nCurrently I am working on the pilot chapter of “The future is in your hands”.\nI have 2 degrees (Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Tourism and Cultural Heritage) and I lived in different countries, such as Italy, China, France and Germany.\nI am fond of food, foreign cultures and languages (I speak Italian, English, French, Chinese Mandarin and German).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","title":"About me"}]
